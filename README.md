## Getting Started

## About
This project is developed based on the unmaintained [react-native-material-design][] and [react-native-material-kit][] libraries. The goal being to replace the two libraries with one library implementing all components supported by either library, merge the two communities into one, implement core features that both libraries are missing, and fix some persistent of the bugs in each library.

Much of the new foundation and merge work was done at [Redwerks](http://redwerks.org/).
